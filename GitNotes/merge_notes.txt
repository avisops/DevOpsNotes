       Incorporates changes from the named commits (since the time their
       histories diverged from the current branch) into the current branch.
       This command is used by ggiitt ppuullll to incorporate changes from another
       repository and can be used by hand to merge changes from one branch
       into another.

       Assume the following history exists and the current branch is mmaasstteerr:

                     A---B---C topic
                    /
               D---E---F---G master

       Then ggiitt mmeerrggee ttooppiicc will replay the changes made on the ttooppiicc branch
       since it diverged from mmaasstteerr (i.e., EE) until its current commit (CC) on
       top of mmaasstteerr, and record the result in a new commit along with the
       names of the two parent commits and a log message from the user
       describing the changes. Before the operation, OORRIIGG__HHEEAADD is set to the
       tip of the current branch (GG).

                     A---B---C topic
                    /         \
               D---E---F---G---H master

       A merge stops if there’s a conflict that cannot be resolved
       automatically or if ----nnoo--ccoommmmiitt was provided when initiating the merge.
       At that point you can run ggiitt mmeerrggee ----aabboorrtt or ggiitt mmeerrggee ----ccoonnttiinnuuee.

       ggiitt mmeerrggee ----aabboorrtt will abort the merge process and try to reconstruct
       the pre-merge state. However, if there were uncommitted changes when
       the merge started (and especially if those changes were further
       modified after the merge was started), ggiitt mmeerrggee ----aabboorrtt will in some
       cases be unable to reconstruct the original (pre-merge) changes.
       Therefore:

           WWaarrnniinngg

           Running ggiitt mmeerrggee with non-trivial uncommitted changes is
           discouraged: while possible, it may leave you in a state that is
           hard to back out of in the case of a conflict.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       ----ccoommmmiitt, ----nnoo--ccoommmmiitt
           Perform the merge and commit the result. This option can be used to
           override ----nnoo--ccoommmmiitt.

           With ----nnoo--ccoommmmiitt perform the merge and stop just before creating a
           merge commit, to give the user a chance to inspect and further
           tweak the merge result before committing.

           Note that fast-forward updates do not create a merge commit and
           therefore there is no way to stop those merges with ----nnoo--ccoommmmiitt.
           Thus, if you want to ensure your branch is not changed or updated
           by the merge command, use ----nnoo--ffff with ----nnoo--ccoommmmiitt.

       ----eeddiitt, --ee, ----nnoo--eeddiitt
           Invoke an editor before committing successful mechanical merge to
           further edit the auto-generated merge message, so that the user can
           explain and justify the merge. The ----nnoo--eeddiitt option can be used to
           accept the auto-generated message (this is generally discouraged).
           The ----eeddiitt (or --ee) option is still useful if you are giving a draft
           message with the --mm option from the command line and want to edit
           it in the editor.

           Older scripts may depend on the historical behaviour of not
           allowing the user to edit the merge log message. They will see an
           editor opened when they run ggiitt mmeerrggee. To make it easier to adjust
           such scripts to the updated behaviour, the environment variable
           GGIITT__MMEERRGGEE__AAUUTTOOEEDDIITT can be set to nnoo at the beginning of them.

       ----cclleeaannuupp==_<_m_o_d_e_>
           This option determines how the merge message will be cleaned up
           before committing. See ggiitt--ccoommmmiitt(1) for more details. In addition,
           if the _<_m_o_d_e_> is given a value of sscciissssoorrss, scissors will be
           appended to MMEERRGGEE__MMSSGG before being passed on to the commit
           machinery in the case of a merge conflict.

       ----ffff, ----nnoo--ffff, ----ffff--oonnllyy
           Specifies how a merge is handled when the merged-in history is
           already a descendant of the current history.  ----ffff is the default
           unless merging an annotated (and possibly signed) tag that is not
           stored in its natural place in the rreeffss//ttaaggss// hierarchy, in which
           case ----nnoo--ffff is assumed.

           With ----ffff, when possible resolve the merge as a fast-forward (only
           update the branch pointer to match the merged branch; do not create
           a merge commit). When not possible (when the merged-in history is
           not a descendant of the current history), create a merge commit.

           With ----nnoo--ffff, create a merge commit in all cases, even when the
           merge could instead be resolved as a fast-forward.

           With ----ffff--oonnllyy, resolve the merge as a fast-forward when possible.
           When not possible, refuse to merge and exit with a non-zero status.

       --SS[_<_k_e_y_-_i_d_>], ----ggppgg--ssiiggnn[==_<_k_e_y_-_i_d_>], ----nnoo--ggppgg--ssiiggnn
           GPG-sign the resulting merge commit. The _<_k_e_y_-_i_d_> argument is
           optional and defaults to the committer identity; if specified, it
           must be stuck to the option without a space.  ----nnoo--ggppgg--ssiiggnn is
           useful to countermand both ccoommmmiitt..ggppggSSiiggnn configuration variable,
           and earlier ----ggppgg--ssiiggnn.

       ----lloogg[==_<_n_>], ----nnoo--lloogg
           In addition to branch names, populate the log message with one-line
           descriptions from at most _<_n_> actual commits that are being merged.
           See also ggiitt--ffmmtt--mmeerrggee--mmssgg(1).

           With ----nnoo--lloogg do not list one-line descriptions from the actual
           commits being merged.

       ----ssiiggnnooffff, ----nnoo--ssiiggnnooffff
           Add a SSiiggnneedd--ooffff--bbyy trailer by the committer at the end of the
           commit log message. The meaning of a signoff depends on the project
           to which you’re committing. For example, it may certify that the
           committer has the rights to submit the work under the project’s
           license or agrees to some contributor representation, such as a
           Developer Certificate of Origin. (See
           hhttttppss::////ddeevveellooppeerrcceerrttiiffiiccaattee..oorrgg for the one used by the Linux
           kernel and Git projects.) Consult the documentation or leadership
           of the project to which you’re contributing to understand how the
           signoffs are used in that project.

           The ----nnoo--ssiiggnnooffff option can be used to countermand an earlier
           ----ssiiggnnooffff option on the command line.

       ----ssttaatt, --nn, ----nnoo--ssttaatt
           Show a diffstat at the end of the merge. The diffstat is also
           controlled by the configuration option merge.stat.

           With --nn or ----nnoo--ssttaatt do not show a diffstat at the end of the
           merge.

       ----ccoommppaacctt--ssuummmmaarryy
           Show a compact-summary at the end of the merge.

       ----ssqquuaasshh, ----nnoo--ssqquuaasshh
           Produce the working tree and index state as if a real merge
           happened (except for the merge information), but do not actually
           make a commit, move the HHEEAADD, or record $$GGIITT__DDIIRR//MMEERRGGEE__HHEEAADD (to
           cause the next ggiitt ccoommmmiitt command to create a merge commit). This
           allows you to create a single commit on top of the current branch
           whose effect is the same as merging another branch (or more in case
           of an octopus).

           With ----nnoo--ssqquuaasshh perform the merge and commit the result. This
           option can be used to override ----ssqquuaasshh.

           With ----ssqquuaasshh, ----ccoommmmiitt is not allowed, and will fail.

       ----[nnoo--]vveerriiffyy
           By default, the pre-merge and commit-msg hooks are run. When
           ----nnoo--vveerriiffyy is given, these are bypassed. See also ggiitthhooookkss(5).

       --ss _<_s_t_r_a_t_e_g_y_>, ----ssttrraatteeggyy==_<_s_t_r_a_t_e_g_y_>
           Use the given merge strategy; can be supplied more than once to
           specify them in the order they should be tried. If there is no --ss
           option, a built-in list of strategies is used instead (oorrtt when
           merging a single head, ooccttooppuuss otherwise).

       --XX _<_o_p_t_i_o_n_>, ----ssttrraatteeggyy--ooppttiioonn==_<_o_p_t_i_o_n_>
           Pass merge strategy specific option through to the merge strategy.

       ----vveerriiffyy--ssiiggnnaattuurreess, ----nnoo--vveerriiffyy--ssiiggnnaattuurreess
           Verify that the tip commit of the side branch being merged is
           signed with a valid key, i.e. a key that has a valid uid: in the
           default trust model, this means the signing key has been signed by
           a trusted key. If the tip commit of the side branch is not signed
           with a valid key, the merge is aborted.

       ----ssuummmmaarryy, ----nnoo--ssuummmmaarryy
           Synonyms to ----ssttaatt and ----nnoo--ssttaatt; these are deprecated and will be
           removed in the future.

       --qq, ----qquuiieett
           Operate quietly. Implies ----nnoo--pprrooggrreessss.

       --vv, ----vveerrbboossee
           Be verbose.

       ----pprrooggrreessss, ----nnoo--pprrooggrreessss
           Turn progress on/off explicitly. If neither is specified, progress
           is shown if standard error is connected to a terminal. Note that
           not all merge strategies may support progress reporting.

       ----aauuttoossttaasshh, ----nnoo--aauuttoossttaasshh
           Automatically create a temporary stash entry before the operation
           begins, record it in the ref MMEERRGGEE__AAUUTTOOSSTTAASSHH and apply it after the
           operation ends. This means that you can run the operation on a
           dirty worktree. However, use with care: the final stash application
           after a successful merge might result in non-trivial conflicts.

       ----aallllooww--uunnrreellaatteedd--hhiissttoorriieess
           By default, ggiitt mmeerrggee command refuses to merge histories that do
           not share a common ancestor. This option can be used to override
           this safety when merging histories of two projects that started
           their lives independently. As that is a very rare occasion, no
           configuration variable to enable this by default exists or will be
           added.

       --mm _<_m_s_g_>
           Set the commit message to be used for the merge commit (in case one
           is created).

           If ----lloogg is specified, a shortlog of the commits being merged will
           be appended to the specified message.

           The ggiitt ffmmtt--mmeerrggee--mmssgg command can be used to give a good default
           for automated ggiitt mmeerrggee invocations. The automated message can
           include the branch description.

       ----iinnttoo--nnaammee _<_b_r_a_n_c_h_>
           Prepare the default merge message as if merging to the branch
           _<_b_r_a_n_c_h_>, instead of the name of the real branch to which the merge
           is made.

       --FF _<_f_i_l_e_>, ----ffiillee==_<_f_i_l_e_>
           Read the commit message to be used for the merge commit (in case
           one is created).

           If ----lloogg is specified, a shortlog of the commits being merged will
           be appended to the specified message.

       ----rreerreerree--aauuttoouuppddaattee, ----nnoo--rreerreerree--aauuttoouuppddaattee
           After the rerere mechanism reuses a recorded resolution on the
           current conflict to update the files in the working tree, allow it
           to also update the index with the result of resolution.
           ----nnoo--rreerreerree--aauuttoouuppddaattee is a good way to double-check what rreerreerree
           did and catch potential mismerges, before committing the result to
           the index with a separate ggiitt aadddd.

       ----oovveerrwwrriittee--iiggnnoorree, ----nnoo--oovveerrwwrriittee--iiggnnoorree
           Silently overwrite ignored files from the merge result. This is the
           default behavior. Use ----nnoo--oovveerrwwrriittee--iiggnnoorree to abort.

       ----aabboorrtt
           Abort the current conflict resolution process, and try to
           reconstruct the pre-merge state. If an autostash entry is present,
           apply it to the worktree.

           If there were uncommitted worktree changes present when the merge
           started, ggiitt mmeerrggee ----aabboorrtt will in some cases be unable to
           reconstruct these changes. It is therefore recommended to always
           commit or stash your changes before running ggiitt mmeerrggee.

           ggiitt mmeerrggee ----aabboorrtt is equivalent to ggiitt rreesseett ----mmeerrggee when
           MMEERRGGEE__HHEEAADD is present unless MMEERRGGEE__AAUUTTOOSSTTAASSHH is also present in
           which case ggiitt mmeerrggee ----aabboorrtt applies the stash entry to the
           worktree whereas ggiitt rreesseett ----mmeerrggee will save the stashed changes in
           the stash list.

       ----qquuiitt
           Forget about the current merge in progress. Leave the index and the
           working tree as-is. If MMEERRGGEE__AAUUTTOOSSTTAASSHH is present, the stash entry
           will be saved to the stash list.

       ----ccoonnttiinnuuee
           After a ggiitt mmeerrggee stops due to conflicts you can conclude the merge
           by running ggiitt mmeerrggee ----ccoonnttiinnuuee (see "HOW TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS"
           section below).

       _<_c_o_m_m_i_t_>...
           Commits, usually other branch heads, to merge into our branch.
           Specifying more than one commit will create a merge with more than
           two parents (affectionately called an Octopus merge).

           If no commit is given from the command line, merge the
           remote-tracking branches that the current branch is configured to
           use as its upstream. See also the configuration section of this
           manual page.

           When FFEETTCCHH__HHEEAADD (and no other commit) is specified, the branches
           recorded in the .ggiitt//FFEETTCCHH__HHEEAADD file by the previous invocation of
           ggiitt ffeettcchh for merging are merged to the current branch.

PPRREE--MMEERRGGEE CCHHEECCKKSS
       Before applying outside changes, you should get your own work in good
       shape and committed locally, so it will not be clobbered if there are
       conflicts. See also ggiitt--ssttaasshh(1). ggiitt ppuullll and ggiitt mmeerrggee will stop
       without doing anything when local uncommitted changes overlap with
       files that ggiitt ppuullll/ggiitt mmeerrggee may need to update.

       To avoid recording unrelated changes in the merge commit, ggiitt ppuullll and
       ggiitt mmeerrggee will also abort if there are any changes registered in the
       index relative to the HHEEAADD commit. (Special narrow exceptions to this
       rule may exist depending on which merge strategy is in use, but
       generally, the index must match HHEEAADD.)

       If all named commits are already ancestors of HHEEAADD, ggiitt mmeerrggee will exit
       early with the message "Already up to date."

FFAASSTT--FFOORRWWAARRDD MMEERRGGEE
       Often the current branch head is an ancestor of the named commit. This
       is the most common case especially when invoked from ggiitt ppuullll: you are
       tracking an upstream repository, you have committed no local changes,
       and now you want to update to a newer upstream revision. In this case,
       a new commit is not needed to store the combined history; instead, the
       HHEEAADD (along with the index) is updated to point at the named commit,
       without creating an extra merge commit.

       This behavior can be suppressed with the ----nnoo--ffff option.

TTRRUUEE MMEERRGGEE
       Except in a fast-forward merge (see above), the branches to be merged
       must be tied together by a merge commit that has both of them as its
       parents.

       A merged version reconciling the changes from all branches to be merged
       is committed, and your HHEEAADD, index, and working tree are updated to it.
       It is possible to have modifications in the working tree as long as
       they do not overlap; the update will preserve them.

       When it is not obvious how to reconcile the changes, the following
       happens:

        1. The HHEEAADD pointer stays the same.

        2. The MMEERRGGEE__HHEEAADD ref is set to point to the other branch head.

        3. Paths that merged cleanly are updated both in the index file and in
           your working tree.

        4. For conflicting paths, the index file records up to three versions:
           stage 1 stores the version from the common ancestor, stage 2 from
           HHEEAADD, and stage 3 from MMEERRGGEE__HHEEAADD (you can inspect the stages with
           ggiitt llss--ffiilleess --uu). The working tree files contain the result of the
           merge operation; i.e. 3-way merge results with familiar conflict
           markers <<< ====== >>>.

        5. A ref named AAUUTTOO__MMEERRGGEE is written, pointing to a tree corresponding
           to the current content of the working tree (including conflict
           markers for textual conflicts). Note that this ref is only written
           when the oorrtt merge strategy is used (the default).

        6. No other changes are made. In particular, the local modifications
           you had before you started merge will stay the same and the index
           entries for them stay as they were, i.e. matching HHEEAADD.

       If you tried a merge which resulted in complex conflicts and want to
       start over, you can recover with ggiitt mmeerrggee ----aabboorrtt.

MMEERRGGIINNGG TTAAGG
       When merging an annotated (and possibly signed) tag, Git always creates
       a merge commit even if a fast-forward merge is possible, and the commit
       message template is prepared with the tag message. Additionally, if the
       tag is signed, the signature check is reported as a comment in the
       message template. See also ggiitt--ttaagg(1).

       When you want to just integrate with the work leading to the commit
       that happens to be tagged, e.g. synchronizing with an upstream release
       point, you may not want to make an unnecessary merge commit.

       In such a case, you can "unwrap" the tag yourself before feeding it to
       ggiitt mmeerrggee, or pass ----ffff--oonnllyy when you do not have any work on your own.
       e.g.

           git fetch origin
           git merge v1.2.3^0
           git merge --ff-only v1.2.3

HHOOWW CCOONNFFLLIICCTTSS AARREE PPRREESSEENNTTEEDD
       During a merge, the working tree files are updated to reflect the
       result of the merge. Among the changes made to the common ancestor’s
       version, non-overlapping ones (that is, you changed an area of the file
       while the other side left that area intact, or vice versa) are
       incorporated in the final result verbatim. When both sides made changes
       to the same area, however, Git cannot randomly pick one side over the
       other, and asks you to resolve it by leaving what both sides did to
       that area.

       By default, Git uses the same style as the one used by the "merge"
       program from the RCS suite to present such a conflicted hunk, like
       this:

           Here are lines that are either unchanged from the common
           ancestor, or cleanly resolved because only one side changed,
           or cleanly resolved because both sides changed the same way.
           <<<<<<< yours:sample.txt
           Conflict resolution is hard;
           let's go shopping.
           =======
           Git makes conflict resolution easy.
           >>>>>>> theirs:sample.txt
           And here is another line that is cleanly resolved or unmodified.

       The area where a pair of conflicting changes happened is marked with
       markers <<<<<<<, ==============, and >>>>>>>. The part before the ============== is
       typically your side, and the part afterwards is typically their side.

       The default format does not show what the original said in the
       conflicting area. You cannot tell how many lines are deleted and
       replaced with Barbie’s remark on your side. The only thing you can tell
       is that your side wants to say it is hard and you’d prefer to go
       shopping, while the other side wants to claim it is easy.

       An alternative style can be used by setting the mmeerrggee..ccoonnfflliiccttSSttyyllee
       configuration variable to either ddiiffff33 or zzddiiffff33. In ddiiffff33 style, the
       above conflict may look like this:

           Here are lines that are either unchanged from the common
           ancestor, or cleanly resolved because only one side changed,
           <<<<<<< yours:sample.txt
           or cleanly resolved because both sides changed the same way.
           Conflict resolution is hard;
           let's go shopping.
           ||||||| base:sample.txt
           or cleanly resolved because both sides changed identically.
           Conflict resolution is hard.
           =======
           or cleanly resolved because both sides changed the same way.
           Git makes conflict resolution easy.
           >>>>>>> theirs:sample.txt
           And here is another line that is cleanly resolved or unmodified.

       while in zzddiiffff33 style, it may look like this:

           Here are lines that are either unchanged from the common
           ancestor, or cleanly resolved because only one side changed,
           or cleanly resolved because both sides changed the same way.
           <<<<<<< yours:sample.txt
           Conflict resolution is hard;
           let's go shopping.
           ||||||| base:sample.txt

           Conflict resolution is hard.
           =======
           Git makes conflict resolution easy.
           >>>>>>> theirs:sample.txt
           And here is another line that is cleanly resolved or unmodified.

       In addition to the <<<<<<<, ==============, and >>>>>>> markers, it uses
       another ||||||| marker that is followed by the original text. You can
       tell that the original just stated a fact, and your side simply gave in
       to that statement and gave up, while the other side tried to have a
       more positive attitude. You can sometimes come up with a better
       resolution by viewing the original.

       After seeing a conflict, you can do two things:

       •   Decide not to merge. The only clean-ups you need are to reset the
           index file to the HHEEAADD commit to reverse 2. and to clean up working
           tree changes made by 2. and 3.; ggiitt mmeerrggee ----aabboorrtt can be used for
           this.

       •   Resolve the conflicts. Git will mark the conflicts in the working
           tree. Edit the files into shape and ggiitt aadddd them to the index. Use
           ggiitt ccoommmmiitt or ggiitt mmeerrggee ----ccoonnttiinnuuee to seal the deal. The latter
           command checks whether there is a (interrupted) merge in progress
           before calling ggiitt ccoommmmiitt.

       You can work through the conflict with a number of tools:

       •   Use a mergetool.  ggiitt mmeerrggeettooooll to launch a graphical mergetool
           which will work through the merge with you.

       •   Look at the diffs.  ggiitt ddiiffff will show a three-way diff,
           highlighting changes from both the HHEEAADD and MMEERRGGEE__HHEEAADD versions.
           ggiitt ddiiffff AAUUTTOO__MMEERRGGEE will show what changes you’ve made so far to
           resolve textual conflicts.

       •   Look at the diffs from each branch.  ggiitt lloogg ----mmeerrggee --pp _<_p_a_t_h_> will
           show diffs first for the HHEEAADD version and then the MMEERRGGEE__HHEEAADD
           version.

       •   Look at the originals.  ggiitt sshhooww ::11::ffiilleennaammee shows the common
           ancestor, ggiitt sshhooww ::22::ffiilleennaammee shows the HHEEAADD version, and ggiitt sshhooww
           ::33::ffiilleennaammee shows the MMEERRGGEE__HHEEAADD version.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       •   Merge branches ffiixxeess and eennhhaanncceemmeennttss on top of the current branch,
           making an octopus merge:

               $ git merge fixes enhancements

       •   Merge branch oobbssoolleettee into the current branch, using oouurrss merge
           strategy:

               $ git merge -s ours obsolete

       •   Merge branch mmaaiinntt into the current branch, but do not make a new
           commit automatically:

               $ git merge --no-commit maint

           This can be used when you want to include further changes to the
           merge, or want to write your own merge commit message.

           You should refrain from abusing this option to sneak substantial
           changes into a merge commit. Small fixups like bumping
           release/version name would be acceptable.

MMEERRGGEE SSTTRRAATTEEGGIIEESS
       The merge mechanism (ggiitt mmeerrggee and ggiitt ppuullll commands) allows the
       backend _m_e_r_g_e _s_t_r_a_t_e_g_i_e_s to be chosen with --ss option. Some strategies
       can also take their own options, which can be passed by giving
       --XX_<_o_p_t_i_o_n_> arguments to ggiitt mmeerrggee and/or ggiitt ppuullll.

       oorrtt
           This is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging one
           branch. This strategy can only resolve two heads using a 3-way
           merge algorithm. When there is more than one common ancestor that
           can be used for 3-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common
           ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the 3-way merge.
           This has been reported to result in fewer merge conflicts without
           causing mismerges by tests done on actual merge commits taken from
           Linux 2.6 kernel development history. Additionally this strategy
           can detect and handle merges involving renames. It does not make
           use of detected copies. The name for this algorithm is an acronym
           ("Ostensibly Recursive’s Twin") and came from the fact that it was
           written as a replacement for the previous default algorithm,
           rreeccuurrssiivvee.

           In the case where the path is a submodule, if the submodule commit
           used on one side of the merge is a descendant of the submodule
           commit used on the other side of the merge, Git attempts to
           fast-forward to the descendant. Otherwise, Git will treat this case
           as a conflict, suggesting as a resolution a submodule commit that
           is descendant of the conflicting ones, if one exists.

           The oorrtt strategy can take the following options:

           oouurrss
               This option forces conflicting hunks to be auto-resolved
               cleanly by favoring _o_u_r version. Changes from the other tree
               that do not conflict with our side are reflected in the merge
               result. For a binary file, the entire contents are taken from
               our side.

               This should not be confused with the oouurrss merge strategy, which
               does not even look at what the other tree contains at all. It
               discards everything the other tree did, declaring _o_u_r history
               contains all that happened in it.

           tthheeiirrss
               This is the opposite of oouurrss; note that, unlike oouurrss, there is
               no tthheeiirrss merge strategy to confuse this merge option with.

               •   If _t_h_e_i_r version only introduces whitespace changes to a
                   line, _o_u_r version is used;

               •   If _o_u_r version introduces whitespace changes but _t_h_e_i_r
                   version includes a substantial change, _t_h_e_i_r version is
                   used;

               •   Otherwise, the merge proceeds in the usual way.

               of any file which needs a three-way merge. This option is meant
               to be used when merging branches with different clean filters
               or end-of-line normalization rules. See "Merging branches with

               Use a different diff algorithm while merging, which can help
               avoid mismerges that occur due to unimportant matching lines
               (such as braces from distinct functions). See also ggiitt--ddiiffff(1)

           ssuubbttrreeee[==_<_p_a_t_h_>]
               This option is a more advanced form of _s_u_b_t_r_e_e strategy, where
               the strategy makes a guess on how two trees must be shifted to
               match with each other when merging. Instead, the specified path
               is prefixed (or stripped from the beginning) to make the shape
               of two trees to match.

       rreeccuurrssiivvee
           This is now a synonym for oorrtt. It was an alternative implementation
           until v2.49.0, but was redirected to mean oorrtt in v2.50.0. The
           previous recursive strategy was the default strategy for resolving
           two heads from Git v0.99.9k until v2.33.0.

       rreessoollvvee
           This can only resolve two heads (i.e. the current branch and
           another branch you pulled from) using a 3-way merge algorithm. It
           tries to carefully detect criss-cross merge ambiguities. It does
           not handle renames.

       ooccttooppuuss
           This resolves cases with more than two heads, but refuses to do a
           complex merge that needs manual resolution. It is primarily meant
           to be used for bundling topic branch heads together. This is the
           default merge strategy when pulling or merging more than one
           branch.

       oouurrss
           This resolves any number of heads, but the resulting tree of the
           merge is always that of the current branch head, effectively
           ignoring all changes from all other branches. It is meant to be
           used to supersede old development history of side branches. Note
           that this is different from the --XXoouurrss option to the oorrtt merge
           strategy.

       ssuubbttrreeee
           This is a modified oorrtt strategy. When merging trees A and B, if B
           corresponds to a subtree of A, B is first adjusted to match the
           tree structure of A, instead of reading the trees at the same
           level. This adjustment is also done to the common ancestor tree.

       With the strategies that use 3-way merge (including the default, oorrtt),
       if a change is made on both branches, but later reverted on one of the
       branches, that change will be present in the merged result; some people
       find this behavior confusing. It occurs because only the heads and the
       merge base are considered when performing a merge, not the individual
       commits. The merge algorithm therefore considers the reverted change as
       no change at all, and substitutes the changed version instead.

           Sets default options for merging into branch _<_n_a_m_e_>. The syntax and
           supported options are the same as those of ggiitt mmeerrggee, but option
           values containing whitespace characters are currently not
           supported.

       Everything above this line in this section isn’t included from the ggiitt--
       ccoonnffiigg(1) documentation. The content that follows is the same as what’s
       found there:

       mmeerrggee..ccoonnfflliiccttSSttyyllee
           Specify the style in which conflicted hunks are written out to
           working tree files upon merge. The default is "merge", which shows
           a <<<<<<< conflict marker, changes made by one side, a ==============
           marker, changes made by the other side, and then a >>>>>>> marker.
           An alternate style, "diff3", adds a ||||||| marker and the original
           text before the ============== marker. The "merge" style tends to produce
           smaller conflict regions than diff3, both because of the exclusion
           of the original text, and because when a subset of lines match on
           the two sides, they are just pulled out of the conflict region.
           Another alternate style, "zdiff3", is similar to diff3 but removes
           matching lines on the two sides from the conflict region when those
           matching lines appear near either the beginning or end of a
           conflict region.

       mmeerrggee..ddeeffaauullttTTooUUppssttrreeaamm
           If merge is called without any commit argument, merge the upstream
           branches configured for the current branch by using their last
           observed values stored in their remote-tracking branches. The
           values of the bbrraanncchh..<current bbrraanncchh>..mmeerrggee that name the branches
           at the remote named by bbrraanncchh.._<_c_u_r_r_e_n_t_-_b_r_a_n_c_h_>..rreemmoottee are
           consulted, and then they are mapped via rreemmoottee.._<_r_e_m_o_t_e_>..ffeettcchh to
           their corresponding remote-tracking branches, and the tips of these
           tracking branches are merged. Defaults to true.

       mmeerrggee..ffff
           By default, Git does not create an extra merge commit when merging
           a commit that is a descendant of the current commit. Instead, the
           tip of the current branch is fast-forwarded. When set to ffaallssee,
           this variable tells Git to create an extra merge commit in such a
           case (equivalent to giving the ----nnoo--ffff option from the command
           line). When set to oonnllyy, only such fast-forward merges are allowed
           (equivalent to giving the ----ffff--oonnllyy option from the command line).

       mmeerrggee..vveerriiffyySSiiggnnaattuurreess
           If true, this is equivalent to the ----vveerriiffyy--ssiiggnnaattuurreess command line
           option. See ggiitt--mmeerrggee(1) for details.

       mmeerrggee..bbrraanncchhddeesscc
           In addition to branch names, populate the log message with the
           branch description text associated with them. Defaults to false.

       mmeerrggee..lloogg
           In addition to branch names, populate the log message with at most
           the specified number of one-line descriptions from the actual
           commits that are being merged. Defaults to false, and true is a
           synonym for 20.

       mmeerrggee..ssuupppprreessssDDeesstt
           By adding a glob that matches the names of integration branches to
           this multi-valued configuration variable, the default merge message
           computed for merges into these integration branches will omit "into
           _<_b_r_a_n_c_h_-_n_a_m_e_>" from its title.

           An element with an empty value can be used to clear the list of
           globs accumulated from previous configuration entries. When there
           is no mmeerrggee..ssuupppprreessssDDeesstt variable defined, the default value of
           mmaasstteerr is used for backward compatibility.

       mmeerrggee..rreennaammeeLLiimmiitt
           The number of files to consider in the exhaustive portion of rename
           detection during a merge. If not specified, defaults to the value
           of ddiiffff..rreennaammeeLLiimmiitt. If neither mmeerrggee..rreennaammeeLLiimmiitt nor
           ddiiffff..rreennaammeeLLiimmiitt are specified, currently defaults to 7000. This
           setting has no effect if rename detection is turned off.

       mmeerrggee..rreennaammeess
           Whether Git detects renames. If set to ffaallssee, rename detection is
           disabled. If set to ttrruuee, basic rename detection is enabled.
           Defaults to the value of diff.renames.

       mmeerrggee..ddiirreeccttoorryyRReennaammeess
           Whether Git detects directory renames, affecting what happens at
           merge time to new files added to a directory on one side of history
           when that directory was renamed on the other side of history.
           Possible values are:

           ffaallssee
               Directory rename detection is disabled, meaning that such new
               files will be left behind in the old directory.

           ttrruuee
               Directory rename detection is enabled, meaning that such new
               files will be moved into the new directory.

           ccoonnfflliicctt
               A conflict will be reported for such paths.

           If mmeerrggee..rreennaammeess is ffaallssee, mmeerrggee..ddiirreeccttoorryyRReennaammeess is ignored and
           treated as ffaallssee. Defaults to ccoonnfflliicctt.

       mmeerrggee..rreennoorrmmaalliizzee
           Tell Git that canonical representation of files in the repository
           has changed over time (e.g. earlier commits record text files with
           _C_R_L_F line endings, but recent ones use _L_F line endings). In such a
           repository, for each file where a three-way content merge is
           needed, Git can convert the data recorded in commits to a canonical
           form before performing a merge to reduce unnecessary conflicts. For
           more information, see section "Merging branches with differing
           checkin/checkout attributes" in ggiittaattttrriibbuutteess(5).

       mmeerrggee..ssttaatt
           What, if anything, to print between OORRIIGG__HHEEAADD and the merge result
           at the end of the merge. Possible values are:

           ffaallssee
               Show nothing.

           ttrruuee
               Show ggiitt ddiiffff ----ddiiffffssttaatt ----ssuummmmaarryy OORRIIGG__HHEEAADD.

           ccoommppaacctt
               Show ggiitt ddiiffff ----ccoommppaacctt--ssuummmmaarryy OORRIIGG__HHEEAADD.

           but any unrecognised value (e.g., a value added by a future version
           of Git) is taken as ttrruuee instead of triggering an error. Defaults
           to ttrruuee.

       mmeerrggee..aauuttooSSttaasshh
           When set to ttrruuee, automatically create a temporary stash entry
           before the operation begins, and apply it after the operation ends.
           This means that you can run merge on a dirty worktree. However, use
           with care: the final stash application after a successful merge
           might result in non-trivial conflicts. This option can be
           overridden by the ----nnoo--aauuttoossttaasshh and ----aauuttoossttaasshh options of ggiitt--
           mmeerrggee(1). Defaults to ffaallssee.

       mmeerrggee..ttooooll
           Controls which merge tool is used by ggiitt--mmeerrggeettooooll(1). The list
           below shows the valid built-in values. Any other value is treated
           as a custom merge tool and requires that a corresponding
           mmeerrggeettooooll.._<_t_o_o_l_>..ccmmdd variable is defined.

       mmeerrggee..gguuiittooooll
           Controls which merge tool is used by ggiitt--mmeerrggeettooooll(1) when the
           --gg/----gguuii flag is specified. The list below shows the valid built-in
           values. Any other value is treated as a custom merge tool and
           requires that a corresponding mmeerrggeettooooll.._<_g_u_i_t_o_o_l_>..ccmmdd variable is
           defined.
